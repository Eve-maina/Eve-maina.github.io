Hi, I’m Eve Maina, a cybersecurity analyst passionate about making a meaningful impact in the digital world.

I am currently exploring cloud security, learning how to protect and manage resources while understanding how systems communicate. My background in computer networking helps me analyze traffic, spot threats, and defend interconnected systems.

I enjoy Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, sharpening my skills in detecting vulnerabilities and investigating incidents.

Guided by integrity, resilience, and excellence, I see cybersecurity as more than protecting systems — it’s about building trust and a safer digital future.

Outside of work, I find inspiration in music, walks, and nature.
