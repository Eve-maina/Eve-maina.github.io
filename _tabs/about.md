Hi there! 👋 I’m **Eve Maina**, a passionate **Cybersecurity Analyst** driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to make a real impact in the digital space.  

I’m currently **exploring cloud security**, learning how to protect and manage resources in cloud environments while understanding how they connect to broader network infrastructures. My solid foundation in **computer networking** complements my cybersecurity work, allowing me to analyze traffic, identify threats, and understand how systems communicate — a skill I consider essential for defending today’s interconnected world.  

I actively participate in **Capture the Flag (CTF)** competitions, where I enjoy applying analytical thinking to solve real-world security challenges. These experiences have sharpened my ability to detect vulnerabilities, investigate incidents, and think like an attacker — while defending like an analyst.  

As a **security analyst**, I’m particularly drawn to **Security Operations Centers (SOC)** , where every log, packet, and alert tells a story waiting to be uncovered. I find purpose in investigating anomalies, understanding how breaches unfold, and developing strategies to strengthen digital defenses.  

Beyond the technical side, I hold deeply to values of **integrity, resilience, and excellence**. I believe cybersecurity is more than just protecting systems — it’s about building trust and enabling a safer digital future for everyone.  

When I’m not immersed in security analysis, I enjoy listening to music, taking peaceful walks, and admiring nature — finding balance in the quiet moments that inspire creativity.
